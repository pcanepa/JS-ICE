BUILDING THE SITE:

run build-site-01-jsmol.xml to unzip libjs/jsmol.zip into site/.
run build-site-02-jice.xml to create j-ice.js and transfer necessary file into site/.

You only have to run build-site-01-jsmol.xml if there is a new jsmol.zip file.

2018.09.13 -- new jsmol.zip adds features for symmetry operators and 
proper primitive unitcells. (Crystal does not use the standard primitive cell for C lattice.
See ice.out.)

2018.09.10 -- new jsmol.zip fixes problem with checkboxes in menu items
